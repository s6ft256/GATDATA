# Visualization Column Selector Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. Column selectors (X-Axis and Y-Axis) were not showing descriptive placeholder options
2. Labels for column selectors were not updating based on chart type
3. Validation messages were not specific enough about which column was missing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Column Selector Population
- Added descriptive placeholder options to both X-Axis and Y-Axis selectors:
  ```javascript
  xColumnSelector.innerHTML = '<option value="">Select X-Axis Column...</option>';
  yColumnSelector.innerHTML = '<option value="">Select Y-Axis Column...</option>';
  ```

### 2. Dynamic Label Updates
- Updated labels to be more descriptive based on chart type:
  - For histogram and pie charts: "Column" (since they only need one column)
  - For other charts: "X-Axis Column" and "Y-Axis Column"

### 3. Improved Validation Messages
- Made error messages more specific:
  - "Please select an X-Axis column."
  - "Please select a Y-Axis column."
  - "Please select a column." (for charts that only need one column)

## Testing
To test these fixes:
1. Open the application and navigate to the Dashboard tab
2. Select a collection from the dropdown
3. Click "Generate Visualizations"
4. Select a chart type
5. Verify that:
   - Column selectors show descriptive placeholder options
   - Labels update appropriately based on chart type
   - Validation messages are clear and specific

## Benefits
- Improved user experience with clearer instructions
- Reduced confusion about which columns are required for different chart types
- Better error messaging for faster troubleshooting
