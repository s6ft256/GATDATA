# CORS Fix Summary

## Issue
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/api/visualize-firestore' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

## Root Cause
The Flask backend server was not configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which is required when making requests from a browser to a different origin (in this case, from the HTML file to the backend server).

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Manual CORS Headers
Instead of using the flask-cors package (which had installation issues), we manually added CORS headers to all responses:

```python
# Add CORS headers to all responses
@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
    response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type,Authorization')
    response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS')
    return response
```

### 2. Added Preflight Request Handler
Added a specific handler for OPTIONS requests (preflight requests):

```python
# Handle preflight requests
@app.route('/api/<path:path>', methods=['OPTIONS'])
def handle_options(path):
    return '', 200
```

## Verification
- The backend server is now running successfully
- CORS headers are being added to all responses
- Preflight OPTIONS requests are being handled correctly
- The server logs show that OPTIONS requests to /api/visualize-firestore are returning 200 status codes

## Testing Recommendations
1. Open the HTML file in a browser
2. Navigate to the Dashboard tab
3. Select a collection and click "Generate Visualizations"
4. Verify that the request is no longer blocked by CORS policy

## Notes
- The "Warning: Firebase not initialized" message is expected if Firebase credentials are not set up
- The backend is running in debug mode, which is appropriate for development
- For production deployment, a proper WSGI server should be used instead of the Flask development server
